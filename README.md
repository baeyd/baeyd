## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;
<p dir="auto">
For the past five years, I've primarily focused on infrastructure system operation, security monitoring, security operations, and vulnerability assessment.<br>
Currently, I'm working as a police officer.<br>
I have a keen interest in automation to enhance work efficiency and aspire to be versatile in all aspects.
